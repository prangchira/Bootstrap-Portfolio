# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Code Bootstrap Portfolio

In this challenge, I created Portfolio page using Bootstrap 4.0.0 with the following features:
- A Navigation bar
- Links to navigate to the appropriate sections
- Minimize the use of media queries.
- Hyperlinks with hover effects.
- Buttons displaying a box shadow upon hover.

## Credit
I would like thank TA Samuel Cordova (https://github.com/SamuelDuartedeCordova) and TA Asia, for their guidance and help on this project. 

I would also like to credit the format of the cool linear gradient button from this website (https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/best-css-button-hover-effects/)
